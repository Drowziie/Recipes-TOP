        <li><em>Ground meat</em></li>
          <li><em>Onion</em></li>
            <li><em>Tomatoes</em></li>

           <li><em>Basil</em></li>
           <li><em>Spaghetti</em></li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong><em>Steps</em></strong></p>
    <ol>
        <li><em>Heat the oil in a large pot over medium-high heat (we use a Dutch oven). Add the meat and cook until browned, about 8 minutes. As the meat cooks, use a wooden spoon to break it up into smaller crumbles.</em></li>
        <li><em>Add the onions and cook, stirring every once and a while, until softened, about 5 minutes.</em></li>
        <li><em>Stir in the garlic, tomato paste and cook, stirring continuously for about 1 minute.</em></li>
        <li><em>Pour in the water and use a wooden spoon to scrape up any bits of meat or onion stuck to the bottom of the pot. Stir in the tomatoes, 3/4 teaspoon of salt, and a generous pinch of black pepper. Bring the sauce to a low simmer. Cook, uncovered, at a low simmer for 25 minutes. As it cooks, stir and taste the sauce a few times so you can adjust the seasoning accordingly.</em></li>
        <li><em>About 15 minutes before the sauce finishes cooking, bring a large pot of salted water to the boil, and then cook pasta according to package directions, but check for doneness a minute or two before the suggested cooking time.</em></li>
        <li><em>Take the sauce off of the heat, and then stir in the basil. Toss in the cooked pasta, and then leave for a minute so that the pasta absorbs some of the sauce. Toss again, and then serve.</em></li>
    </ol>
